Indeed, the mysterious object kept growing, taking on an increasingly human-like appearance. By the time she was just a few steps away, it was unmistakably an entity with facial featuresâ€”eyes, a nose, a mouth. It could be none other than the infamous HUMPTY DUMPTY. That much was certain, as though his identity was written across his visage.

His large face could easily have accommodated the name a hundredfold. Perched atop a towering, narrow wall with legs folded in a manner reminiscent of a yogi, Humpty Dumpty paid no attention to her. His gaze was fixated elsewhere, leading her to believe he might just be an inanimate sculpture.

"What a remarkable resemblance to an egg," she commented, her hands poised to catch him, expecting him to topple at any moment.

"Quite irritating to be constantly referred to as an egg," Humpty Dumpty finally spoke, without making eye contact.

"I said you resembled an egg," she clarified softly, adding, "And some eggs are quite aesthetically pleasing," hoping to smooth over her earlier statement.

"Sense is something that seems to elude certain individuals," he retorted, still not facing her.

Left without a proper reply, she started muttering a nursery rhyme under her breath:

    Humpty Dumpty perched on a ledge,
    Humpty Dumpty teetered on the edge.
    Neither King's cavalry nor King's men,
    Could ever restore Humpty's position again.

"The final line doesn't quite fit the metric structure," she almost said out loud, but then remembered he would hear her.

"Stop mumbling to yourself and state your purpose," he demanded, finally acknowledging her presence.

"My name is Alice," she started, but he cut her off.

"An uninspiring name, to say the least," he interrupted. "Does it signify anything?"

"Should a name signify something?" she questioned.

"Absolutely," he snorted. "My name signifies my form, which is strikingly handsome, if I may say so. With a name like Alice, one could be anything."

"Why are you sitting here all alone?" she queried, hoping to avoid a confrontation.

"Because there's no one else here, obviously," he huffed, visibly annoyed by the question.

"Wouldn't it be safer on the ground?" she ventured, worried about his precarious position.

"Child's play, these questions of yours," he grumbled. "There's no chance I'd fall, but even if I did..." His expression turned so austere that she nearly burst into laughter. "Even if I did, the King would send his entire brigade to fetch me."

"To fetch you with all his horses and all his men?" she interjected.

"How dare you eavesdrop!" he roared. "You must have been spying to know that!"

"Actually, it's common knowledge, found in a book," she reassured him.

"Ah, history books," he muttered, calming down. "Very well, I'll let you shake hands with a creature who has conversed with a King. And don't worry about my mouth extending too far. My head won't come off."

"Are you sure you'd be saved so quickly?" she went on.

"Of course! But let's slow down, this conversation is getting ahead of itself."

"I can't recall your last comment," she admitted.

"Then we'll start anew," he concluded, "And now it's my turn to quiz you. State your age."

She quickly did the math and responded, "Seven years and six months."

"Incorrect," he boasted. "You never mentioned such a thing!"

"You misunderstood," she sighed. "I thought you were asking about my age."

"If I'd meant that, I would have said so," retorted Humpty Dumpty.
